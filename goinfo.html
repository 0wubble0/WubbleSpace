            <ul class="bullet-points">
              <li>group orders are a way for you to buy specific pobs or participate in lucky draws or get merch while saving on international shipping costs entirely!</li>
              <li>typically, my group orders have two payments: initial (for the merch), and doms (domestic shipping, either stamped or tracked.)</li>
              <li>because of my unique situation in korea, international shipping is free, so there is no additional EMS fee for my group orders.</li>
              <li>for payment options, i take paypal, venmo, and zelle.</li>
              <li>i do NOT make any money from my group orders! i host solely for the purpose of giving people a chance to bypass international shipping fees.</li>
              <li>I DO NOT HOST GROUP ORDERS FOR FANCALL ATTEMPTS OR FANCALL RAFFLES WHATSOEVER. DO NOT REQUEST THAT I HOST FOR A FANCALL.</li>
              <li>groupchats will be made for each group order to make sure communication is clear and concise!</li>
              <li>ONCE ITEMS ARE SENT OUT I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST, DAMAGED OR STOLEN MAIL. NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN IN THIS REGARD.</li>
              <li>go proofs: #ÏõåÎ∏îÏ¶ùÍ±∞ on twitter!</li>
              <li>dm me for any questions üíô</li>
            </ul>

              <li>usa based, and worldwide friendly, unless stated otherise.</li>
              <li>payment due dates are included with the original post, and are (mostly) strict. if you need an extension, let me know, i am flexible, but if you have not reached out, payment deadlines are strict.</li>
              <li>no backouts are to be made unless you can find a replacement, so make sure you are 100% committed to a group order once i have confirmed your claim!</li>
              <li>group order claim shipment details will be included in the original post, so you know what you are getting in terms of other inclusions and albums.</li>
              <li>have patience! these orders are sent to my family home in korea before getting shipped to me, so it may take a while for them to get here. in the meantime, i will send frequent updates in our group order chat! please be kind in the group chats, i'd hate to ban you from future group orders!</li>
              <li>BY JOINING MY GROUP ORDER, YOU ARE AGREEING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL RULES ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, YOU ARE AGREEING TO POST OR SEND PROOF WHEN YOU RECEIVE YOUR ITEMS IF POSSIBLE. PROOF IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT LETS ME KNOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR ITEMS AND IT IS A WAY TO SHOW FUTURE JOINERS THAT I AM A TRUSTWORTHY GOM.</li>

              <li>giveaways are usa based, worldwide friendly! i may require you to pay shipping if you live in certain countries where shipping costs are high.</li>
              <li>giveaway details will be specifically written in the post! typical entries are just a follow, retweet, and like. if i am giving away more than one item, you also may have to comment which items you would like entries for!</li>
              <li>BY JOINING MY GIVEAWAY, YOU ARE AGREEING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL RULES ABOVE.
